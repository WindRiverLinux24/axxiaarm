4. Axxiaarm BSP Notes
=====================

4.1 Hardware Description
--------------------------

There are two modules in the evaluation board, EP4(ep5020 ppc cpu) and
A15(ARM Cortex a15 cpu). The module on the rear panel of EVA board is EP4,
2 ethernets on it are used by EP4 only. The front ethernet is used by A15.

For complete LSI ARM Amarillo details please directly contact LSI.

4.2 Validated Board Info
------------------

NOTE: This BSP is only validated in the following environment, if used in a
different environment it may run into unknown issues.

	Intel AXM5516 Amarillo:
	----------------------
	Processor:		ARMv7 Processor rev 2
	BootLoader:		U-Boot
	BootLoader Version:	axxia_u-boot_5.8.1.96

4.3 Known Issues
----------------
1) In some cases, DMA gets into a bad state, this will cause network run
   with "net eth0: acp-femac: No end of packet! 2/0/0/0" issue,
   when this error happened, acp-femac driver will reset the MAC as a workaround
   to recover the network, we can temporarily ignore this error log.

5. Axxiaarm64 BSP Notes
=======================

5.1 Hardware Description
------------------------

For complete Intel ARM64 axm56xx Victoria details please directly contact Intel.

5.2 Validated Board Info
----------------

NOTE: This BSP is only validated in the following environment, if used in a
different environment it may run into unknown issues.

	Intel AXM5616 Victoria:
	----------------------
	Processor:		ARMv8 Processor rev 3
	BootLoader:		U-Boot
	BootLoader Version: 	u-boot_v2015.10_axxia_1.99
	ATF Version:		atf_84091c4_axxia_1.43

5.3 Known Issues
----------------
1) when boot with Network File System(NFS), high frequent write operations on
   manually mounted BTRFS or XFS file system space will cause the NFS hang
   with "nfs: server 192.168.10.20 not responding, still trying", this issue
   is still under investigation.
